                      The Education in sub continent does not bridge the gap between academics and skills required in industry and therefore except graduates from few top colleges, others do not find job in the real world. Lack of basic skills set and the limited bookish knowledge stay limited to books whereas the industry is looking for realistic knowledge. Only one third of the graduates are employable in any industry and the challenge is to provide employability to rest two third graduates. Country's economy is growing at the rate of approx 7% but the rate of employment has declined. According to a recent study, approx 30% of youth aged 15-29 in the country are not either in employment, education or training. Today 65% chunk of Country’s population is in the working age group though both central and state governments with their several schemes are working to give the right direction to this huge workforce to make them employable and productive for the nation and it needs the support from the private sector as well both form education and industry front. </p>

                      Our approach is to build up the association with stakeholders like Trainers, Trainee, Government and Industries to create smart knowledgeable and self motivated workforce and leaders to industry. We create inspiring modern environment to transform unutilized workforce into productive manpower to nation’s development. We believe that one should have multiple disciplinary Skills, knowledge, talent, professional development and sufficient industry exposure to make himself a value asset for the industry and nation. </p>
                    <p class="c-font-justify">
                      We are working in the area of skill development closely with National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) under Ministry of Skill Development & Entrepreneurship (MSDC), Ministry of Minority Affairs and Ministry of Housing and Urban Development through Sector Skill Councils</p>
                    <p class="c-font-justify">
                      We are looking for long term association and welcome industry partners, Trainers, Professionals to join us in our initiative to make it more meaningful, fruitful and successful in delivering to society. </p>
